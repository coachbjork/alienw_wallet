customized AI platform offered to Metaverse players through Telegram’s social media app. This platform offers creators free tools to imagine and create the Metaverse.\nSome of the ways creators have been using Quantumoid this year:\n\n1) Imagining the elements of planets\n2) Creating images of places they want to see in the planets\n3) Imagining functions and services of these places\n4) Creating images of events and experiences to chronicle them\n5) Drafting language and creating images regardless of language proficiency\n6) Attracting other creators \n\nThe program evokes feelings of empowerment and belonging among participants by providing tools and incentives for user-generated content, a collaborative environment where\ncreators feel valued and motivated to share their unique talents and perspectives.\n\nIt communicates that every player has the potential to shape the world of Alien Worlds through their contributions, whether they are artists, storytellers, developers, or simply enthusiasts with creative visions (^^,)\n\nInsights: \n\n》 Community Engagement: Engaging with the community is crucial for fostering a vibrant and dynamic\nenvironment where users feel connected to both the platform and each other. \n\n》 User Empowerment: Giving users the tools and recognition they need empowers them to create content that\ncan significantly enhance everyone's experience. \n\n》 Economic Incentives: Providing economic incentives not only stimulates participation but also helps sustain a thriving ecosystem where creators can benefit from their efforts. \n\n》 Creativity: Encouraging creativity leads to diverse content which enriches the metaverse, making\nit more appealing and engaging for current users while attracting new ones. \n\n》 Continuous Adaptation: Working on such campaigns highlights the importance of being adaptable, listening to feedback, analyzing engagement metrics, and continuously refining strategies to support growth.\n\nThe program exemplifies how user-centric initiatives can drive engagement in virtual worlds like\nAlien Worlds by creating an emotionally resonant experience centered around co-creation, shared goals, and mutual growth within its digital space.\n\n\nWe are requesting the following support:\n》 5,000 TLM per month for hosting fees\n》 5,000 TLM per month for creator contest rewards through bounties \n\nTo

We're slowly growing adoption, over the last month have seen 135 unique accounts joining quests and 91 of them succeeding in quests.\n\nBy adding those new features/functions, a few new issues and needed improvements were needed.  We first started noticing some performance issues over the weekends with progress taking quite a while to show up.  After lots of troubleshooting we narrowed the fixed down to the progress calculations and updated settings so can process more information and not get backed up.  Additionally, we found that when adding the $KEK token, the interfaces did not handle token quantities very well, so we updated the fields and displays to either have commas or shortened display.  Also, to better accommodate the community sponsored events, we are adding an admin section to manage reward tokens to make it easier to setup community quests.  Lastly, we are also looking to add more information about the quest creation to the on-chain action, specifically which client (kavian/neri) the quest is for.\n\nTotal efforts for this round of

success in seeing up to 40 people per day participating in some of the daily quests.  One feature the community has requested is a more detailed display of the quest critera progress.  The system was originally designed for smaller quantities of mobs/blocks but when larger multiple target quests are created, it's difficult to know the details of your progress to identify what is remaining.\n\nWe propose adding an additional feature to the system that tracks and displays the individual quest requirements and provides a more detailed breakdown for the users.  We have already begun development on this feature and expect to roll it out in next few weeks after testing.

has become an essential tool for the Alien Worlds decentralized ecosystem. \nThe site, backend and upcoming features is actively being worked on for many hours each week, the majority is done in the backend and on new features. \n\nThis proposal is to fund the ongoing maintenance of the site and surrounding tools. Alienw recently added 2 new server and 6 new Enterprise grade SSD drives to improve and secure the growing database. As well as set up two WAX State History nodes for improved speed and reliability of the data moving forward. \n\nCurrently working on locating and solving a bug in the Nodeos State History code, the bug is sometimes resulting in the Database Indexer to stop. \n\nAlso work is being done to failover between the two different State History Nodes to hopefully remove most risks of missed data. \n\n Thank you all for using Alienw.com, and thank you for the support. \n\nThe Last 30 days, alienw has 4.9k visits by 923 unique users.

This program aims to enhance Alien Worlds' presence in the Chinese community through strategic community operations, content creation, event planning, localization support, and more. Our approach involves breaking down monthly goals into weekly increments, allowing us to adapt and optimize strategies as we progress. After the initial 10 weeks, we will reassess and make adjustments based on the program's effectiveness.\n\nAdapting to the Alien Worlds Ecosystem:\nCommunity Building: Establish a dedicated Chinese community section for discussion, sharing, and learning.\n\nContent Creation: Translate official information, craft game guides, and produce localized visual content to cater to the information needs of Chinese users.\n\nEvent Planning: Regularly organize online activities, in-game tasks, and community events to boost player engagement.\n\nLocalization Support: Provide dedicated customer support, answering questions and ensuring a positive user experience.\n\nOriginal Article Writing: Attract and convert new players to join the Alien Worlds metaverse.\n\nExplore new avenues, continually optimize, and work towards the ultimate goal!\n\nProgram Goals:\nCommunity Growth: Increase the total number of Chinese community members by at least 2.5% weekly, enhancing community activity.\n\nContent Output: Publish a minimum of 1-2 Chinese articles and create no fewer than 1-2 localized visual content pieces each week.\n\nEvent Hosting: Organize at least 2-4 online community events monthly to attract more Chinese users' participation.\n\nProgram Feasibility and Team Capability:\nOur team, consisting of gaming enthusiasts, Chinese/media editors, and community operations experts, brings extensive experience in gaming community operations and dedicates full-time commitment to this program.\n\nAttractiveness and Sustainability:\nRegular updates of community content, engaging online events, and effective localization support will ensure the attractiveness of the Chinese community. Establishing a community autonomy mechanism will encourage active participation and ensure the program's self-sufficiency post-grant period.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Chinese Community Engagement Pilot Program for Alien Worlds is essential for enhancing visibility, increasing community engagement, providing localized support, creating compelling content, and establishing a self-sustaining community ecosystem. Our goal is to build a dynamic and informative Chinese community for Alien Worlds. Through practical efforts, we aim to strengthen Alien Worlds' recognition and user engagement in the Chinese community. We appreciate your support in jointly driving the success of Alien Worlds in the Chinese community.","proposal_status":1,"approved_by":["tzgai.wam","neyau.wam","anyo.cabal"],"created":"2023-12-05T11:24:28","modified":"2023-12-05T13:05:59","expiration":"2023-12-12T11:24:01","trx_id":"d234b4ad8b6a24b65c4e278297359d91434e31de4463dbd8f6c2997e405f139a","unique_hash":"d234b4ad8b6a24b65c4e278297359d91434e31de4463dbd8f6c2997e405f139az5wrsnyzfy1d","actions":[{"contract_name":"alien.worlds","action_name":"transfer","action_data":{"from":"kavian.dac","to":"3.kaw.wam","quantity":"250000.0000 TLM","memo":"N/A"}}]},{"_num":276,"schema_version":1,"planet":"kavian","proposal_title":"- No title -","proposal_id":"bzabk24mxdao","proposer":"tzgai.wam","trx_contracts":{"0":{"dao.worlds":"claimbudget"}},"trx_actions":{"0":{"dac_id":"kavian"}},"trx_packed":{"0":"000000004ce3b681"},"description":"- No description -","proposal_status":1,"approved_by":["tzgai.wam","neyau.wam","anyo.cabal"],"created":"2023-12-05T11:23:48","modified":"2023-12-06T05:15:45","expiration":"2023-12-12T11:21:32","trx_id":"b08f377b1e50341b9cc69722a804c41ff32fde21b646fccb95804630274bc529","unique_hash":"b08f377b1e50341b9cc69722a804c41ff32fde21b646fccb95804630274bc529bzabk24mxdao","actions":[{"contract_name":"dao.worlds","action_name":"claimbudget","action_data":{"dac_id":"kavian"}}]},{"_num":275,"schema_version":1,"planet":"kavian","proposal_title":"Support the dacoco Lore Initiative","proposal_id":"supportlore2","proposer":"anyo.cabal","trx_contracts":{"0":{"alien.worlds":"transfer"}},"trx_actions":{"0":{"from":"kavian.dac","to":"federation","quantity":"1.0000 TLM","memo":"more lore is cool"}},"trx_packed":{"0":"000032094ce3b68100c0a42e9bab925a102700000000000004544c4d00000000116d6f7265206c6f726520697320636f6f6c"},"description":"Dacoco has collaborated with a known sci-fi author (Kevin J.

The narratives we weave give life, context, and meaning to every action, every planet, and every life form in our expansive universe. \n\n Dacoco is excited to share that we have teamed up with esteemed Sci-Fi Author [REDACTED] to present the beginning of a reimagined, more expansive lore for Alien Worldsu2014one that goes beyond our current narrative and offers a richer backdrop for our shared universe. This tale transcends our current narrative and embroiders a more immersive tapestry for storytelling, portraying the genesis, challenges, and dreams of the myriad races within our shared Metaverse, with Trilium at its epicenter. \n\n Proposed Lore: \n Trilium is the most bioreactive natural substance in the known Metaverse. It accelerates the mutation and replication of genetic material at an unparalleled rate in its raw form. This spells catastrophe for any organisms that make contact. The race that discovered Trilium, [REDACTED], researched it, refined it, and harnessed it. Ultimately, they discovered that they could precisely control the effect Trilium had on genetic material using technology they called [REDACTED]. They could eliminate disease, slow down aging, and make themselves better, faster, and stronger with super-organic abilities. But, the effects were temporary, only lasting as long as one could supply the [REDACTED] technology with Trilium. This had profound impacts on every aspect of their society, economy, and culture. Eventually, the [REDACTED] ran out of Trilium and turned to the stars to locate more. Using Trilium and [REDACTED] technology to enhance their ability to survive in other atmospheres, the [REDACTED] began the Great Expansion, where an unprecedented exchange of culture, knowledge, and technology occurred as contact was made between more and more sentient species. Now, the only known supplies of Trilium are on six planets: Magor, Eyeke, Neri, Kavian, Naron, and Veles and are controlled by powerful Syndicates. Today, Trilium is at the center of the Metaverse. u2018Why solve the mystery of life when weu2019ve solved the mystery of death?u2019- Notes from a Trilium Researcher Why this is Important: \n\n Consistency: A unified, overarching lore ensures that all players, developers, and stakeholders share a common understanding of the Alien Worlds universe, enhancing immersion and engagement. \n\n Depth: This introduces layers of complexityu2014economic, political, culturalu2014that can spur countless stories, missions, challenges, and innovations within the Metaverse. \n\n Growth: A compelling story attracts a broader audience, enhances retention, and stimulates community involvement and content creation. Community Building: A shared narrative fosters a sense of belonging, allowing players to find purpose and align themselves with the larger goals of the Alien Worlds metaverse. \n\n Decentralization: Collaboratively building this new world brings a new focus for decentralization. When the community controls the story it can eventually control the IP and beyond. \n We are optimistic that this enriched narrative will resonate with all members of the Metaverse, enhancing the Alien Worlds experience for every Explorer, builder, and creator. It is our belief that the next great IP will emerge not from a corporation, but from a community. \n This is only the beginning.

Past Dacathon resources can be reviewed at https://www.dacathon.com/ Dacathon has a heritage with Alien Worlds. Much of its activities led to participants becoming players and staff members at Alien Worlds since.\n\nNote, during the planning process, the participants will determine the length, if there is a hackathon portion (like in Dacathon, for code or ideas), if there are prize pools, how much discussion, the types of discussion, the use of Consortium for participant voting and if any video interviews (like in the first Dacathon).\nProject Milestones - The When\nOnce three or more Planets agree to support the Unconference, dates will be established for the following Milestones:\n\nPlanning discussion session at an AW Fractally meeting\nContent - Concepts, issues and questions to pose to participants\nCurriculum - Degree of interest in hackathon, discussion sessions, presentations\nDates - Select dates for Dacathon\nPlan timeline (following Dacathon model - see some past resources here)\nPlanets Unconference Dates\nThe Requested Funding\nHow much do you request for your project?\n\n“I am requesting 200,000 TLM per Planet to support my efforts organizing Dacathon. This will result in 600,000 to 1,200,000 TLM across the Planets, depending upon participation. In the past, Dacathon typically took a good part of 3 months to plan and host.” - Lisa Chandler\n\nWallet Address: jbhqu.wam\n\nIn the future, the Unconference will likely create rewards pools and after discussion, may return to request additional resources for rewards pools, specific event activities or project coordinators, if proposed during discussion.\nTeam Information -
